		 <h3><b>What is it?</b></h3>
		 <p>Too often there are artists across the world that have amazing ideas who are unable to gain access to the tools they need or the people to push them.  Reason ranging from living in rural cities away from the resources they need or wanting to collaborate with someone who is across the country.  Atricity aims to solve this altogether.</p>
		 <h3><b>What does it offer?</b></h3>
		 There are two main aspects of Atricity.  
		 <ol>
			<li><b>The Band Room</b>
				<p>Here artists can come together in a unique virtual bandroom complete in which anyone with an internet connection can enter and play together with anyone and everyone.  There are options to have sheet music open, add band members by username or do a search for players of a specific instrument, and options to record once the players are ready.</p> 
			</li>
			<li><b>Player Finder</b>
				<p>In this area there is just a list of people offering their talents as well as people looking for others to play with.  There are filter options to sort my level of expertise along with instruments played.  Clicking on a post there is the information about the user and other forum options and an option to immediately start a band room with that person.</p>
